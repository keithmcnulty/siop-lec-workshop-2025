## Overview

This course covers some of the most commonly used methods of explanatory modeling and inference when working with data related to people. Among other things, you will learn about:
* Typical explanatory analyses conducted on people data
* Common people-related data types 
* Common hypothesis testing methods
* Common explanatory modeling methods

You will learn by working through code and data examples, and you'll be given follow up resources and a take home project to put your learning into practice.

## Learning objectives

To be able to:
* Understand basic principles of statistical inference and know how to conduct tests of difference in populations based on samples
* Understand how to conduct and interpret a suite of explanatory modeling techniques which are used to analyze common outcome types in people analytics (continuous, binary, ordinal, time-dependent)
* Use integrated data science documents to execute analyses and explain methods and results based on all the above.

## Is this course for me?

This course will be valuable to you if: 
 
- You currently work or intend to work in a people-related discipline. 

- You have a basic working knowledge of R and RStudio. 

- You are interested in learning applied statistical methods that are commonly used to understand and draw conclusions about common people outcomes in organizations.  
 
The course is ideal for someone who is likely to study quantitative social science disciplines to an advanced level, as well as those working in quantitative Human Resources roles in organizations.

## Prework

* **Essential:**  Register for a Posit Cloud account at https://posit.cloud
* *Optional:* Review the module on R fundamentals to ensure that you have a basic familiarity with how R works.
